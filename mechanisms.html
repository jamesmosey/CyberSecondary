                <h2>Strong Passwords</h2>
                <p>Strong passwords are a fundamental element of cybersecurity that help protect against various types of attacks, reduce the risk of unauthorized access, and safeguard sensitive information. One reason why having a strong password is essential is to protect yourself against 
                    brute force attacks. Brute force attacks involve attackers using automated tools to guess passwords repeatedly until they find the correct one. </p>
                <div class="hiddencontent1">
                    <p>Strong passwords, which are 
                        typically longer and contain a mix of upper and lower case letters, numbers, and special 
                        characters, are much harder and more time-consuming for these tools to crack. </p>

                <h2>User Authentication</h2>
                <p>User authentication is an essential element of a robust cybersecurity strategy. It helps 
                    ensure that only authorized individuals can access systems and data, protects sensitive 
                    information, and mitigates various types of cyber threats. It is the process of verifying someone’s identity before allowing them access to a system 
                    or data. It ensures only the right people can access the sensitive information within a 
                    system.</p>
                <div class="hiddencontent2">
                    <p>One way user authentication is used to help with cybersecurity is with data protection. 
                        User authentication helps protect sensitive information by making sure that only the 
                        right people can access it.</p>

                <h2>Firewalls</h2>
                <p>Firewalls are like security guards for your computer network. They decide which data can come in and go out, based on rules set by the network owner. "This software or dedicated hardware-software unit functions by selectively blocking or allowing data packets. It is typically intended to help prevent malicious activity and to prevent anyone—inside or outside a private network—from engaging in unauthorized web activities". (kaspersky, 2020)</p>

                    <p>Firewalls check all the data coming in and going out of your network, letting in the good stuff and blocking the bad stuff. </p>

                <h2>Encryption</h2>
                <p>Encryption plays a crucial role in enhancing cybersecurity by ensuring the 
                    confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of data. It’s like locking your data in a safe 
                    that only you and trusted people can open, keeping it protected from unauthorized 
                    people. "Encryption is a way of scrambling data so that only authorized parties can understand the information. In technical terms, it is the process of converting human-readable plaintext to incomprehensible text, also known as ciphertext" (Cloudflare, 2024).</p>
                <div class="hiddencontent4">
                    <p>Encryption helps confirm that the people and websites you’re 
                        communicating with are who they say there are. This prevents hackers from pretending 
                        to be someone else to steal your information.</p>

                <h2>Access Control</h2>
                <p>Access control is a cybersecurity measure that ensures only authorized people can 
                    access certain information or resources. Imagine a locked door that only opens for 
                    people with the right key; access control works similarly by allowing only those with 
                    proper permissions to see or use sensitive data. This helps protect important 
                    information, keeps systems secure from insiders who might misuse their access, and 
                    helps companies follow legal rules.</p> 
                <div class="hiddencontent5">
                    <p>In short, access control helps keep valuable data safe 
                        and ensures that only the right people can reach it. </p>

                <h2>Network Segmentation</h2>
                <p>Network segmentation means dividing a large computer network into smaller, separate 
                    parts. This helps improve security by making it harder for attackers to move around if 
                    they get in. It also allows better control over who can access what, makes monitoring 
                    easier, and helps meet security regulations. In short, it keeps different parts of the 
                    network safer and more manageable. </p>
                <div class="hiddencontent6">
                    <p>Network segmentation is also a key part of firewalls, which are important as they help 
                        filter the traffic of what comes data comes in and out of your network.</p>
