                <h2>Active Recall</h2>
                <p>Active Recall is a method of studying that reverses the typical studying format. Instead of trying to learn via putting information directly into the brain through reading or listening to lectures. The student can actively recall/retrieve information from the brain that they have recently learned, through processes such as answering past papers, or completing quizzes online to test themselves. </p>
                <div class="hiddencontent1">
                    <p>This process helps to solidify information learned, and allows students to remember this information easily and much more efficiently than if they were to just read the subject content over and over.</p>

                <h2>Pomodoro Technique</h2>
                <p>The Pomodoro Technique is a method of studying developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s, which helps students maximize learning efficiency, while minimizing distraction and burnout. The technique involves setting a timer for 25 minutes, and studying hard until the timer is up. The student can then allow themselves a 5 minute break, before setting another timer for 25 minutes and repeating the process again.</p>
                <div class="hiddencontent2">
                    <p>Upon completion of four cycles of the pomodoro technique, it is highly advised for the student to allow themselves a longer break. This longer break should be around 25-30 minutes, to allow for proper rest and rejuvenation.</p>

                <h2>Commenting Code</h2>
                <p>Commenting notes into code is an often highly overlooked technique for Computer Science students. By doing so, it forces students to articulate their understanding of the code they have written, therefore reinforcing their learning. A student in the early days of their academic career cannot expect to remember everything about their code by simply typing it out once and then moving on to something else.</p>
                <div class="hiddencontent3">
                    <p>Not only does commenting code help with the learning process, it is also a good practice for a student to take with them after their academic journey and into the workplace. Developers often work in large teams, so correctly commenting code will help others to understand and navigate the code you have written.</p>

                <h2>Leitner System</h2>
                <p>The Leitner System is a more efficient spin on the traditional 'flashcards' method of studying. A simple implementation of this system would involve having 3 boxes, all flashcards start in box 1. The student would go through the flash cards in box 1 and answer them accordingly. Any questions that were correctly answered would be placed into box 2, whereas any questions answered incorrectly remain in box 1. This process can be repeated (always starting with box 1) until all cards end up in box 3.</p>
                <div class="hiddencontent4">
                    <p>This system aims optimize the learning process by spacing out the review of information based on the student's proficiency with the content of each flashcard.</p>

                <h2>The Feynman Technique</h2>
                <p>The main concept of the Feynman Technique is that you should pick a concept or topic you want to learn. Then pretend as if you're teaching it to someone else, or a class of people. This forces you to put it into your own words, thereby solidifying the concept in your brain. It is considered good practice to identify gaps in your understanding as you go along "teaching". 
                <div class="hiddencontent5">
                    <p>Don't forget to go back and review what you have been covering also, consistency is key when it comes to knowledge retention.</p>
